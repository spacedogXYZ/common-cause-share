Protest has been a key instrument in the many historic advances of our country. 

Without the protests, demonstrations, boycotts, and even the riots that led to the American revolution, the US might never have come to be. Popular protest has achieved important social change, from expanding the vote to women and people of color to increasing environmental standards and workplace safety.  

When people feel unheard, they protest. In order to stop protests, leaders must listen to the concerns of their people and address those concerns in a meaningful way. That is what great leadership can do and it is how we will move forward together.
