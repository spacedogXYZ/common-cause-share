        <p style="margin-block-start: 0em;">Partisan special interests are trying to stop people from voting by mail. This is to create distrust in our election systems and spread confusion about when ballots will arrive in the mail. The truth is voting by mail is a tried and tested process that is safe, secure, and trackable. Plus the Postal Service can handle it. You have options for how you cast your ballot, whether it is by mail, in person, or at a dropbox. Visit canivote.org to check the rules and options in your state. 

If you have any questions or issues voting call or text 866-OUR-VOTE (866-687-8683). <span style="color: blue"></span></p>
