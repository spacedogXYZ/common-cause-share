On May 10th, the Senate held a markup for the For the People Act. Some politicians attacked the For the People Act in bad faith and offered up amendments based on disinformation from the 2020 election. This disinformation was rejected, and more importantly, the For the People Act is moving forward. 

The For the People Act is made up of common sense solutions that give everyday people a voice in our democracy. It will make our elections more safe and accessible by setting national standards so every voter, regardless of our zip codes, race, or backgrounds can vote. S1 also limits the power of wealthy special interests and strengthens ethics laws so that we know who is trying to influence our elections. 

This bill must move forward. Failure isn’t an option.
