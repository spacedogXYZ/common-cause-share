Unfortunately, there is a lot of disinformation surrounding the For the People Act. Politically motivated bad actors are working hard to spread lies about unchecked voter malfeasance and branding the legislation as a Democratic scheme in a lazy attempt to maintain political power and keep up voting barriers that have been erected to silence the will of the people. 

In reality, the For the People Act would protect the voting rights of **all** voters, regardless of political affiliation - it also addresses the flaws exploited by both parties. The For the People Act also has multiple sections dedicated to election security ensuring "that American elections are decided by American voters, without interference..." 

All in all, the For the People Act is the most comprehensive democracy reform legislation proposed in Congress in decades, as it tackles money in politics, government ethics, voting rights, election security, and gerrymandering.
