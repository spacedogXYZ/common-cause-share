We may not know who won the GA senate races on January 5th, and that’s ok. Just like the election for president, election officials must take the time to count every vote - because EVERY voter’s voice and opinion matters. 

Officials must take the time to ensure a clear winner decided by the will of the people of Georgia and that could take time. Be patient, and know that county officials are working hard to ensure the results are accurate!
