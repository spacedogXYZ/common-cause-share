share_header: You're almost done!
share_subhead: Use these sharing tools to spread the word
share_text: Every voice deserves to be heard. Voting absentee allows our
  military, seniors and others to take part in our democracy. Politicians can’t
  pick + choose whose vote gets counted. WE pick our leaders. Our democracy is
  strongest when it includes us all.
