We all care about the security, transparency and integrity of our elections and we’re encouraged by the quick work of election officials to address errors or misunderstandings, when and if they arise. Some bad actors try to use these errors to make us feel insecure or suspicious about the election. We cannot let these efforts affect our confidence in our system or our willingness to vote. Your vote matters. We’re all better off when our elections reflect everyone in our community. If you have questions or need help, call or text 866-OUR-VOTE [(866-687-8683](tel:8666878683)).
