share_subhead: Use these sharing tools to spread the word
share_text: We all care about the security and integrity of our elections and
  we’re encouraged by the quick work of election officials to address errors,
  when and if they arise. Some politicians try to use these errors to make us
  feel insecure about the election and make us believe that our votes won’t
  count. We cannot let these efforts affect our confidence in our system or our
  willingness to vote. Your vote matters. We’re all better off when our
  elections reflect everyone in our community. If you have questions or need
  help, call or text 866-OUR-VOTE (866-687-8683).
