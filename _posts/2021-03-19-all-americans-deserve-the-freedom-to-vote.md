share_text: "Most of us believe that for a democracy to work for all, it must
  include us all. While some politicians aim to pass policies to silence the
  voices of Americans, we know that to move forward, we must ensure every
  eligible American has the #FreedomToVote. "

Senator Warnock, first Black senator from Georgia and Senior Pastor of the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, had this to say about the current anti-voter bills moving through state legislatures, “Make no mistake. This is democracy in reverse. Rather than voters being able to pick the politicians, the politicians are trying to cherry pick their voters. This cannot stand.” 

There are more than 250 anti-voter bills that, if passed, would be the biggest restriction of voting rights inflicted upon tens of millions of Americans since the end Reconstruction -- when Southern states curtailed the voting rights of formerly enslaved Black men. 

Most of us, no matter our color, origin, or gender want America to be a place where freedom is for everyone, we all have an equal say, and we can trust in the integrity of our elections. We must protect our right and freedom to vote.
