While provisional ballots are an important last resort, a few simple steps can help you avoid the hassle. Before you go vote, check your state or local elections website to: confirm your registration, double check your assigned polling place (it may have changed!), and learn the ID you need to vote. Have a mail-in ballot but want to vote in person? Many states will allow you to exchange it at the polls. If you are told to cast a provisional ballot, first call 866-OUR-VOTE for help.
