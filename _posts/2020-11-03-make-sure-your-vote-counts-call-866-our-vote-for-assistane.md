Did you know that most states allow you to track your mail-in ballot online to see if it was received, verified, and counted?

In some states, if your ballot cannot be verified, voters can provide additional information to local election officials so it can be counted. 

Check the rules in your state. If election officials inform you more is needed, act fast so your ballot can be counted before the deadline. Have questions or need help? Call your local elections office or 866-OUR-VOTE.
