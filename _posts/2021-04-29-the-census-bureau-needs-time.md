We have to wait for the full assessment of the Census data for accuracy and quality - and that’s ok! 

Never before in our nation’s history has the census taken place in the midst of a global pandemic that has taken the lives of hundreds of thousands of our loved ones. The Census Bureau also endured unprecedented political malfeasance to undercount communities of color, as well as record wildfires, hurricanes, and civil unrest. 

Accurate census data allows for communities of color to stand together with facts and data and stop politicians from depriving us of the ability to gain needed resources, and instead creating a path to equity.

Due to the pandemic and natural disasters, the Census Bureau is taking longer than usual to release data, but it is important to understand that accurately assessing the quality of the data is a process that takes time. Workers are doing their best to ensure the data accurately reflects our communities as best as possible, which will provide us with information that will help us with important decisions in the future!
