We the people, showed up and voted. Election officials prepared for this election all year, counted every vote, verified the results, and followed every law used in every election.  

We have proved nothing can stop us from making our voices heard and our votes counted. Now we move forward together.  

When the leader we - the voters - chose is sworn in as president, democracy wins.
