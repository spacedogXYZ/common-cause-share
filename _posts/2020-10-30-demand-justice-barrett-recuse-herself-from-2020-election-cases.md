Justice Amy Coney Barrett should not rule on cases related to the 2020 election. She was nominated by President Trump, a candidate in this race, just weeks ago -- and confirmed as part of a rushed, hyperpartisan process while the election was already underway. 

These are major conflicts of interest that would make it virtually impossible for Justice Barrett to judge any 2020 election case with impartiality. If she does not recuse herself from these cases, sheâ€™ll be fundamentally impugning the integrity of our Supreme Court.
