The basis of American democracy is that **we pick our leaders** - our leaders do not pick their voters. 

We must count every vote because every voter’s voice and opinion matters. That’s how our democracy works. No candidate can legitimately claim victory before the total votes are counted and the will of the people is heard. 

We need to let our election officials do their job to ensure every vote is accurately and securely counted before we declare a winner.[ ](https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23CountEveryVote)#EveryVoteCounts
