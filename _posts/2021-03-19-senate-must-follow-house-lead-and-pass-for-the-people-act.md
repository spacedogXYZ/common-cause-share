... \[I]n a system awash in dark money and the dominance of corporatist interests and politicians who do their bidding, the voices of the American people have been increasingly drowned out and crowded and squeezed out of their own democracy. **We must pass “For The People” so that the people might have a voice. Your vote is your voice and your voice is your human dignity.”**
