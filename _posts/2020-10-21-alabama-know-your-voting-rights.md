The right to vote and have our voices heard is fundamental to our democracy. Our democracy is stronger when every eligible American participates -- confident that when they cast a vote that it will be counted as cast, that the process is secure, and that anyone who interferes or tampers with our elections will be held accountable. 

**One important way to help your friends, family, and neighbors know their rights is by sharing voting information from trustworthy sources, like your state's Secretary of State website.** 



Use the buttons on this page to help spread the word about this helpful voting information -- we're counting on you to help as many people as possible cast their ballots safely and securely!
