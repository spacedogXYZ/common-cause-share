We must count every vote because every voter’s voice and opinion matters. That’s how our democracy works. 

We have seen young people, Black and Brown people and people struggling to make ends meet, overcome unacceptable barriers to exercise their most basic right as Americans. And now all of us must join together to demand that every eligible vote is honored.

No candidate can legitimately claim victory before the total votes are counted and the will of the people is heard. 

We need to let our election officials do their job to ensure every vote is accurately and securely counted before we declare a winner.[\#](https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23CountEveryVote)EveryVoteCounts
