Amid challenges and intentional barriers, 157 million Americans voted -- more than ever before. And despite flailing attempts by Republicans and violent insurrectionists to override the will of the people, our votes were counted, upheld by the courts, and certified by local, state, and national officials from both sides of the aisle. We made our voices heard and we chose a new path for the country. As our new president is sworn in, we’re ready to stand together to tackle the challenges we face as a nation and restore our health and economy so that all our families can thrive.
