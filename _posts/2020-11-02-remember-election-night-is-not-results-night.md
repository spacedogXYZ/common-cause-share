Having the option to vote-by-mail is critical to ensuring our health and safety this year. Because so many voters submitted mail-in-ballots, we may not know the final results on election night.

Certain politicians want you to think that only votes counted on Election Day matter. The truth is they want to claim victory in the election if it looks like they are leading on election night, but every vote counts. Remember elections arenâ€™t certified on election night. States have rules in place with checks and balances on how to count ballots. 

If you have any questions or issues voting call or text 866-OUR-VOTE (866-687-8683).
