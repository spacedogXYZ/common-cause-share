If you are in line to vote, stay in line. Please know you are allowed to vote as long as you are in line before the polls close! 

Your vote matters. Weâ€™re all better off when our elections reflect everyone in our community. If you have questions or need help, call or text 866-OUR-VOTE (866-687-8683).

If you have already voted, remember to be patient so we can make sure every vote is counted. You can help by sharing your voting story at [helpingvoters.org](https://helpingvoters.org) -- this information will be used by nonpartisan voter protection groups like Common Cause Education Fund to improve our elections. 

Can you share this with your friends and family?
