If you are in line to vote, stay in line. Please know you are allowed to vote as long as you are in line before the polls close! 

Having the option to vote-by-mail is critical to ensuring our health and safety this year. Because so many voters submittied mail-in-ballots, we may not know the final results on election night. Certain politicians want you to think that only votes counted on Election Day matter. The truth is they want to claim victory in the election if it looks like they are leading on election night, but every vote counts. 

Remember elections arenâ€™t certified on election night. States have rules in place with checks and balances on how to count ballots. If you have questions or need help, call or text 866-OUR-VOTE (866-687-8683).

If you have already voted, remember to be patient so we can make sure every vote is counted. You can help by sharing your voting story at [helpingvoters.org](https://helpingvoters.org) -- this information will be used by nonpartisan voter protection groups like Common Cause Education Fund to improve our elections.
