If you see disinformation about the 2020 election, the upcoming impeachment trial of former president Donald Trump, or any other disinformation in an online post or ad, do your part to stop the spread. Don't engage, react or comment — that only means more people will see it! Do take a screenshot to submit it to [ReportDisinfo.org](http://www.reportdisinfo.org/). Then share official voting information, like your local election officials or Secretary of State. Do your part to keep voters and the public safe from disinformation!
