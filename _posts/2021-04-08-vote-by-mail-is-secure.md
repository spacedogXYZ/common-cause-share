Certain politicians are continuing to spread false theories about states that use mail-in ballots. This is to try and weaken your trust in elections. The truth is several states have been doing vote-by-mail for years and have secure processes in place. States like Democratic-controlled Washington and Oregon and Republican-controlled Utah. Itâ€™s not a new thing and has proven to be safe. Our democracy is stronger when more people can participate and every vote counts. Local election officials work hard and use checks and balances to ensure all valid votes are counted during each election, big or small.
