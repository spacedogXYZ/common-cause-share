Certain politicians continue to spread lies about states that use vote by mail. Why? To attempt to weaken your trust in our elections. Vote-by-mail isnâ€™t new: the truth is, states like Democratic-controlled Washington and Oregon and Republican-controlled Utah have used vote-by-mail safely and securely for years. And during this past election cycle, many states also proved that ballot drop off sites, and giving voters options helped voters participate. Our democracy is stronger when more eligible voters can participate and every vote counts. Local election officials work hard and use checks and balances to ensure all valid votes are counted during each election, big or small.
