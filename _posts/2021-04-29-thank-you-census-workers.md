Conducting a census count is difficult under normal conditions, but the 2020 census faced an onslaught of unique challenges including the COVID-19 pandemic, uncertain field operation timelines, and natural disasters.Â Accurate census data will help ensure that Black, Asian, Latinx, and Indigenous communities have the resources for schools where our kids learn, access to public transit to get us to work, and better healthcare to keep us healthy. 

Census workers showed up and went to great lengths to count every person to get an accurate count of our communities. Thank you, census workers, for your immense effort!
