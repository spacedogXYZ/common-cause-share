The attacks on our country at the hands of right-wing militants and at the direction of elected politicians desperate to cling to power were a reminder that we must always defend our democracy. Anyone who tries to subvert the will of the people must be held accountable. But we, the people, are the heroes of this story. Americans know that our country must do better. VotersÂ  -- especially Black, Brown, Indigenous, and Asian Americans, new Americans and young Americans -- turned out in record numbers and chose a new path forward. Now, we come together to build a better future and show who we can be.
