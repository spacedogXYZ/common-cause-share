**We finally have the opportunity to make campaign finance reforms possible for Oregon!**

Voting YES for Ballot Measure 107 will amend our constitution so that we can actually enact laws and push for voter initiatives that would require disclosures on who pays for political, disclosures on campaign contributions and spending, and allow for limits on campaign spending.

We know that over 80% of Oregon voters support campaign finance reforms. This coming legislative session our representatives will make key decisions following the passage of Ballot Measure 107.

What does this mean?

**We need a big win to show our representatives that we are serious about campaign finance reform in Oregon.**
