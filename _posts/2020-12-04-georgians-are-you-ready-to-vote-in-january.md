Voting is our chance to have a say in the future of our families, community, and the state of Georgia -- and in our January runoff election, the decisions we make will determine the future of the country as well. **With the voter registration deadline coming up on Monday, December 7th, we have our work cut out for us.**

1 in 4 Americans isn’t registered to vote, and there’s a good chance that some of your friends, family members, or neighbors are included in that number. And, we know one of the most effective ways to get these people to register is if they’re asked to by someone they know.

So, do you have 5 minutes to make sure you and your friends are ready to vote in January? **You can start by [registering to vote or checking to see if your voter registration is up-to-date](https://registertovote.sos.ga.gov/GAOLVR/).**

**Then -- and here’s the important part -- use our sharing tools to get the word out to your friends, so they can make sure they're ready to go for the January election >>**
