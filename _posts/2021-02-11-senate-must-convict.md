share_text: As we move forward together as a nation, we cannot let those
  responsible for the January 6th attack on our democracy go without
  accountability. Thatâ€™s why the Senate must convict Donald Trump and bar him

The attacks on our country on January 6, 2021 at the hands of right-wing militants, and at the direction of elected politicians desperate to cling to power, were a reminder that we must always defend our democracy. **Anyone** who tries to subvert the will of the people must be held accountable - which is why the Senate must convict former President Trump, even though he has left office. To come together and show who we can be, we must not allow any attacks on our democracy and ensure a country where liberty and justice are for all.
