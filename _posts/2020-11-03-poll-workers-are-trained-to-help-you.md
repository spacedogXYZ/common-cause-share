Voters around the country are showing that nothing can stop them from making their voices heard and making sure that every vote counts. 

With such high voter turnout, some processes take longer or don’t work as planned. But that’s ok! Trained election officials are there to help and follow detailed, secure procedures to handle issues that arise.

If you have any questions or concerns as you vote, ask a poll worker or call 866-OUR-VOTE to speak with a nonpartisan trained volunteer!
