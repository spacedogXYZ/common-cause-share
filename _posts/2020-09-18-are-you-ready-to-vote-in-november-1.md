Voting is our chance to decide what’s best for the future of our families, community, and our country. But one in four Americans isn't registered to vote -- and there’s a good chance that some of your friends, family members, or neighbors are included in that number. 

Celebrate American democracy by making sure you, your friends, family, & community are #VoteReady for the next trip to the ballot box in 2023 AND 2024!

**Take 5 minutes today and make sure you are ready to vote by [registering to vote](https://www.commoncause.org/voting-tools/register-to-vote/) or [checking to see if your voter registration is updated](https://www.commoncause.org/voting-tools/verify-your-voter-registration-status/).**

**Then, use our sharing tools to get the word out to your friends, so they can make sure they're ready to go >>**
