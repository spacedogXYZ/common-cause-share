share_text: As we move forward together as a nation, we cannot let those

The attacks on our country at the hands of right-wing militants and at the direction of elected politicians desperate to cling to power were a reminder that we must always defend our democracy. Anyone who tries to subvert the will of the people must be held accountable - which is why the Senate must convict former President Trump, even after he left office. We must demand accountability for the attack on our democracy. To come together to show who we can be, we must not allow any attacks on our democracy and ensure a country where liberty and justice are for all.
