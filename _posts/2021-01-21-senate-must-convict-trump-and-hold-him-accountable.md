The attacks on our country at the hands of right-wing militants and at the direction of elected politicians desperate to cling to power were a reminder that we must always defend our democracy. Anyone who tries to subvert the will of the people must be held accountable - which is why during the Senate trial for the second impeachment of former President Trump, he must be convicted. To come together to show who we can be, we must not allow any attacks on our democracy and ensure a country where liberty and justice are for all.
