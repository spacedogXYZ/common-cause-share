Most of us believe that for democracy to work for all of us, it must include us all. People across our country have stood with and for each other, rejecting attempts to divide us based on what we look like, where we come from or where we live. Despite COVID, the economic crisis, and deliberate barriers set to silence the voices of people struggling to make ends meet, Black people and new Americans, we turned out in record numbers to pick new leaders who will care and govern for all of us. And now we will hold our new government to account -- not to merely tackle the COVID crisis -- but to make this a place where all of us can thrive. #OurTimeNow
