share_text: We The People deserve a bigger say in electing leaders to solve the
  problems we are facing, from COVID-19 to racial justice. We must pass the For
  the People Act so we the people can ensure our government is focusing on us,
  not wealthy special interests.

In order to build an inclusive democracy that is truly of, by, and for the people, we must focus on the needs of everyday people, not big money donors. That is why it is so crucial to pass the For the People Act, which calls for overturning the Citizens United v. FEC Supreme Court decision. Passing this bill would  limit the power of wealthy special interests in our politics. The bill would create an alternative system for people to run for office without relying on wealthy special interests to fund their campaigns. It would empower small dollar donors. 

We have a right to know who is trying to influence our elected officials and our votes. Citizens United opened new avenues to secret spenders to silence our voices. The For the People Act will require secret money organizations who spend money in elections to publicly disclose their top political donors. 

This simple transparency solution, which many states already have in place, is a common sense piece of legislation included in the For the People Act!
