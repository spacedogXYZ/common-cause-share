share_header: You're almost done!
share_subhead: Use these sharing tools to spread the word
share_text: We need to start a new chapter. That means new leaders who hold
  militants accountable for attacking democracy. It means new actions to stop
  the spread of lies. And it means new rules to empower voters instead of those
  who undermine the will of the people.

Amid challenges and intentional barriers, 157 million Americans voted -- more than ever before. And despite flailing attempts by Republicans and violent insurrectionists to override the will of the people, our votes were counted, upheld by the courts, and certified by local, state, and national officials from both sides of the aisle. We made our voices heard and we chose a new path for the country. As our new president is sworn in, weâ€™re ready to stand together to tackle the challenges we face as a nation and restore our health and economy so that all our families can thrive.
