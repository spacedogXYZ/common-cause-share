title: Election Night is not Results Night -- We Must Count Every Vote
share_header: You're almost done!
share_subhead: Use these sharing tools to spread the word
share_text: With higher numbers of absentee ballots this year, it may take more
  time to count all the votes. We may not know the final election results on
  election night this year. But that’s OK. Counting every vote is more important
  than speedy election results. Election Night ≠ Results Night! If you have
  questions or need help, call or text 866-OUR-VOTE (866-687-8683).

Because so many voters will be submitting mail-in-ballots, we may not know the final results on election night. Certain politicians want you to think that only votes counted on Election Day matter. The truth is they want to claim victory in the election if it looks like they are leading on election night, but every vote counts. Remember elections aren’t certified on election night. States have rules in place with checks and balances on how to count ballots.

Find the rules in your state and how you can receive and submit your mail-in ballot at canivote.org. If you have any questions or issues voting call or text 866-OUR-VOTE (866-687-8683). <span style="color: blue"></span></p>
