We deserve a democracy that equally represents the American people. Tell Congress to pass the For the People Act to create a democracy that works for **all** of us. This bill includes measures to ensure voters have access to the ballot box, politicians are held to account, and big money is kept out of our elections. Let's bring the power back to the people!
