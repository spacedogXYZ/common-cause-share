For democracy to work for all of us, it must include us all. Throughout history, we have fought to ensure more Americans have our right to vote honored and that every eligible American is able to cast their vote and have it counted. However, a handful of politicians are working to take us backwards - using misinformation from the election to inform their decisions and push through bad legislation that will only work to make it harder to vote by erecting barriers, instead of serving their communities when constituents need them most.

To move forward together, we must ensure every eligible American can cast a ballot so we can elect leaders **who govern in all our interests** and make that promise of democracy tangible for all of our communities.
