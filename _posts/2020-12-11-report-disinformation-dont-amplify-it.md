The 2020 election cycle was full of disinformation - and unfortunately, those narratives and more continue to spread across platforms. This includes narratives about voter fraud, our election system, our democracy, and others! If you see disinformation about any of those topics or others in an online post or ad, do your part to stop the spread. 

**Do** take a screenshot to submit it to ReportDisinfo.org!

**Donâ€™t** engage, react or comment -- that only means more people will see it!
