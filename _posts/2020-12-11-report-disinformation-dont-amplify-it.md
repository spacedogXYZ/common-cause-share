This election cycle has been full of disinformation - and it continues to spread across platforms. If you see disinformation about voting in an online post or ad, do your part to stop the spread. 

**Don’t** engage, react or comment -- that only means more people will see it! 

**Do** take a screenshot to submit it to ReportDisinfo.org!
