The For the People Act will end secret, unaccountable money in politics by strengthening disclosure for online political ads and requiring all organizations involved in political activity to disclose their large donors. It also expresses Congress’ support for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United.  

The For the People Act is common sense legislation that will work to create a democracy that works for all of us and where all Americans can thrive, participate, and make their voices heard.
