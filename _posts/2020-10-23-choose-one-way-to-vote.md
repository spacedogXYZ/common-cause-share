        <p style="margin-block-start: 0em;">A politician is dangerously suggesting people vote twice to “test the system.” This is simply to breed confusion and distrust in our electoral system — and is against the law. You MUST choose one way to vote and should make a plan to vote now. Any additional efforts to cast a ballot will not be counted and clogs up the election system. Vote by mail is a safe, secure, and trackable way to vote. Voters can even track their mail-in ballot on their state election board’s website.
