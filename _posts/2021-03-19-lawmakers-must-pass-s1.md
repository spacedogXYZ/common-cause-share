Sen. Rev. Raphael Warnock said it best: “I’m here to say that this issue is bigger than the filibuster. I stand before you saying that this issue—access to voting and preempting politicians’ efforts to restrict voting—is so fundamental to our democracy that it is too important to be held hostage by a Senate rule, especially one historically used to restrict the expansion of basic rights. It is a contradiction to say we must protect minority rights in the Senate while refusing to protect minority rights in our society.” 

This is why we must call on our lawmakers in the Senate to support and pass the For the People Act, S1, and expand access to the ballot box for all eligible Americans.
