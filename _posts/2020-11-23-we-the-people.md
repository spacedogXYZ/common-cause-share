The basis of our democracy is that we pick our leaders, our leaders do not pick and choose their voters. After losing at the ballot box and failing in the courts, Trump is trying to manipulate lawmakers and sow doubts in this election to hold onto power for his own gain. But we #VotersDecided and the will of the people will prevail. In America, we believe in the democratic transfer of power and we’re ready to move forward together to tackle this pandemic and ensure a better future for every American.
