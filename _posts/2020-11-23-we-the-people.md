The basis of our democracy is that we pick our leaders, our leaders do not pick and choose their voters. After losing at the ballot box and failing in the courts, Trump is desperately trying to sow doubts about this election by questioning votes cast by Black, Brown and Indigenous Americans. But we #VotersDecided and the will of the people will prevail. In America, we believe in the democratic transfer of power and we’re ready to move forward together to tackle this pandemic and ensure a better future for every American.
