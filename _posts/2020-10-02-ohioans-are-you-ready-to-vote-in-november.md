**There are two big dates coming up in Ohio -- our voter registration deadline is on Monday, October 5th and Early Vote begins on Tuesday, October 6th.**

1 in 4 Americans isn’t registered to vote, and there’s a good chance that someone in your social circles is included in that number. And, we know one of the most effective ways to get these people to register is if they’re asked to by someone they know.

So, do you have 5 minutes to make sure you are ready to vote in November? **You can start by [registering to vote](https://olvr.ohiosos.gov/) or [checking to see if your voter registration is up-to-date](https://voterlookup.ohiosos.gov/voterlookup.aspx).**

**Then -- and here’s the important part -- use our sharing tools to get the word out to people in your social circle, so they can make sure they're ready to go for the November election >>**
