Some voters received emails or saw posts online claiming someone can know which candidate the voter will choose. This isn’t true. Don’t be fooled by hoaxes aimed at breeding fear and intimidating voters. 

No one, not even election officials, can see who you vote for. It’s important to know your vote is safe and secure no matter how you choose to vote, whether that’s by mail or in person.

If you have any questions or issues voting contact Election Protection at 866-OUR-VOTE.
